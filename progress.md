# ECG DigiAI — Implementation Progress Log

## Project Identity & Academic Scope
- **Project**: ECG Digitisation & Analysis Using AI (ECG DigiAI)
- **Institution**: Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida (ECE Dept)
- **Academic Context**: B.Tech Major Project (Final-Year)
- **Primary Authorities**: Major Project Synopsis & Mid-Viva Presentation

## Technical Strategy Review & Primary Objective Realignment
- **Primary Focus**: Image-to-Signal Digitisation (Component B). The previous `ECGResNet1D` experiment operates strictly on numerical signals for downstream classification (Component C) and does not train the core image digitizer.
- **Kaggle GPU Quota Policy**: No Kaggle GPU quota will be consumed on downstream classification. Remote training will be dedicated to deep learning image-to-signal reconstruction (`ECGDigitizerUNet`).
- **Data Pairing Audit**:
  - `khyeh0719/ptb-xl-dataset` contains 12-lead digital signals but no scanned paper images.
  - `erhmrai/ecg-image-data` contains single-beat crops with no paired digital signals.
  - **Strategy**: Supervised image-to-signal training leverages on-the-fly degraded synthetic paper generation from PTB-XL records to preserve exact ground-truth trace masks and calibrated waveform targets.
- **Detailed Strategic Document**: See [`docs/implementation_roadmap.md`](docs/implementation_roadmap.md).

## Session 1 Verified Milestones (Completed)
- [x] Environment & Hydra config fix: Added `configs/env/default.yaml` with dynamic env interpolation, updated `configs/config.yaml`, and unignored `configs/env/` in `.gitignore`.
- [x] Dataset pairing analysis (`docs/dataset_pairing.md`): Discovered Kaggle images are unpaired beat plots; established ground-truth evaluation discipline using PTB-XL paired synthetic rendering.
- [x] PTB-XL SCP Statement label audit (`docs/label_mapping.md`): Mapped AFIB (1,514), SBRAD (637), STACH (877), STD_ (1,009), BBB (2,273), MI (5,486), and flagged sparse STE_ (28 direct).
- [x] Synthetic ECG Generator (`ecg_digitization.synthetic`): Realistic 12-lead clinical paper grid (1 mm / 5 mm, 25 mm/s, 10 mm/mV, 150 DPI), 3x4 + 1 rhythm strip layout, paired binary trace masks, and configurable photographic degradations.
- [x] Image Preprocessing (`ecg_digitization.preprocessing`): Automated Hough deskewing, dual-domain red-channel/HSV grid suppression, and adaptive Gaussian + Otsu binarization.
- [x] Lead Layout Detector (`ecg_digitization.preprocessing.lead_detector`): Standard 3x4 + 1 rhythm strip and 12x1 layout bounding box extraction.
- [x] Waveform Extractor & Reconstructor (`ecg_digitization.reconstruction`): Active-span column-wise centroid/median tracking, isoelectric baseline subtraction, calibrated mV/time conversion, and uniform 100 Hz resampling.
- [x] Evaluation Harness (`ecg_digitization.evaluation`): Ground-truth comparison measuring Pearson $r$, RMSE, SNR, and completeness ($r \approx 0.9058$ on Lead II).

## Session 2 Verified Milestones (Completed)
- [x] **Physiological Rhythm & Rate Analysis** (`ecg_digitization.inference.analyzer`):
  - Butterworth bandpass filtering (0.5–40 Hz) and Pan-Tompkins QRS R-peak detection.
  - Heart rate calculation (BPM) and RR interval variability ($CV_{RR}$) assessment.
  - Signal Quality Index (good / acceptable / low) with lead-off/flatline detection.
  - Rule-based clinical findings for Sinus Bradycardia ($<60\text{ bpm}$) and Sinus Tachycardia ($>100\text{ bpm}$).
- [x] **AI Multi-Label Classifier & Model Safety Interface** (`ecg_digitization.models`, `inference.classifier_interface`):
  - 1D ResNet baseline architecture (`ECGResNet1D`) retained as auxiliary downstream evaluation module.
  - CPU smoke test: Verified forward pass, finite BCE loss backward pass, checkpoint saving, and checkpoint loading.
  - Clinical decision-support safety: Returns explicit `model_not_trained` status when checkpoint is absent; returns `Not supported by available labels` for sparse direct labels (`STE_`); zero fabricated predictions.
- [x] **Explainable Decision-Support Report Generator** (`ecg_digitization.inference.report_generator`):
  - Generates structured machine-readable JSON and formatted, printable clinical HTML reports.
  - Embeds multi-lead waveform plots, physiological rate measurements, model status, and mandatory regulatory disclaimers.
  - Clinical Risk Level explicitly marked `Not assessed` pending prospective clinical validation.
- [x] **Demonstrable FastAPI Service & Interactive Web Application** (`ecg_digitization.service.app`):
  - Six interactive dashboard screens: Dashboard, Synthetic Generator, Digitisation Pipeline, Reconstructed Waveforms, AI Analysis & Screening, Clinical Report.
  - REST API endpoints for status, sample listing, synthetic generation, digitisation, analysis, and report generation/download.
  - Windows Python 3.14 compatible.
- [x] **Kaggle GPU Training Infrastructure** (`ecg_digitization.training.kaggle_manager`):
  - Automated Kaggle CLI execution wrapper with credential discovery.
  - Packaging of kernel metadata and standalone GPU scripts.
- [x] **Full Test Suite Verification**:
  - **87/87 tests passed** with **85% code coverage**.

## Next Steps: Image-to-Signal Digitizer Training
1. Implement `ECGDigitizerUNet` deep segmentation and differentiable soft-argmax extraction module.
2. Package digitization-focused Kaggle training bundle (`asthak11111/ecg-digiai-unet-training`).
3. Present new Digitisation Job Card for explicit user authorization before Kaggle GPU submission.
